# ct-verify-email

A little script to verify Commercetools user's email.

## Usage: 

- Clone this repo, run `yarn`, and it's ready to use âœ¨
- To verify user's email, run `yarn start` or `node .`
- It will ask for Commercetools project id, client id and secret. After you enter them first time, it will store them for you (unencrypted! ðŸ‘»).
- Enter user's email and hopefully it will get verified ðŸ¤ž
